  quote: Went for a short 2 day break and decided to book a shepherds hut instead of our tent. 5* Fabulous location in that it is quiet and secluded far from any roads. Great views on the edge of the Afan Forest with walks galore. Fantastic friendly hosts who have made this a top site. Eco friendly with clean facilities and well spaced plots. The addition of a fire pit was the icing on the cake...
