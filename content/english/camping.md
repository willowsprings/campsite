    text: We have 10 private non-electric pitches for camper vans, tents, trailer tents, motorhomes (up to 25ft) and day vans. If you're concerned about Wales' climate, there's no need to fret — we have a walk-in drying room to dry clothes and boots, and a large shelter with seating for you to relax under, come rain or shine. Fires and BBQs are encouraged! However, due to our close proximity to Afan Forest, we may have to restrict their use or location if conditions become conducive for forest fires.
